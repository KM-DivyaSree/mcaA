In addition to these restrictions, and in order to provide access to students and under-resourced groups around the world, Colab prioritizes users who are actively programming in a notebook. The following are disallowed from managed Colab runtimes running free of charge, without a positive Colab compute unit balance, and may be terminated at any time without warning: remote control such as SSH shells, remote desktops bypassing the notebook UI to interact primarily via a web UI chess training running distributed computing workers You can remove these types of restrictions by purchasing one of our paid plans here and maintaining a positive compute unit balance. You may find not all runtimes that match the descriptions are terminated; we attempt to support as much as we can within reason to benefit the global community. You can purchase guaranteed resources without Colab-enforced usage limitations via GCP Marketplace or Colab Enterprise or use your own compute via a local runtime you control. Note that Google Drive mounting on the runtime filesystem will not work with these approaches. Why does my Colab runtime keep terminating prematurely?link In order to provide access to students and under-resourced groups around the world, Colab prioritizes users who are actively programming in a notebook. Users in our free of charge tier commonly experience runtime terminations when attempting to bypass the notebook UI and using a web UI on a Colab managed runtime for content generation. These experiences are popular and impressive, but are compute intensive and fall outside our priorities for our free of charge tier users, who we want to help in programming.
