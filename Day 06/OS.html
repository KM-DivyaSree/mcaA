AI Overview
What is an Operating System? Defination, types, and features
An Operating System (OS) is essential system software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between the user and the computer. It handles tasks like memory management, process management, file management, and peripheral device control. Without an OS, a computer would be unable to run applications or perform basic functions. 
Here's a more detailed look:
Key Functions of an Operating System:
Resource Management:
The OS allocates and manages resources like CPU time, memory, storage, and input/output devices to different programs and users. 
Process Management:
It handles the execution of multiple programs, including starting, stopping, and scheduling them efficiently. 
File Management:
The OS provides a way to organize, store, retrieve, and manage files on storage devices. 
User Interface:
It provides a way for users to interact with the computer, whether through a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI). 
Hardware Abstraction:
The OS hides the complexity of the underlying hardware from applications, making it easier to develop and run software. 
Examples of Operating Systems:
Windows: A widely used commercial OS for personal computers. 
macOS: The OS developed by Apple for its Macintosh computers. 
Linux: An open-source OS used in servers, embedded systems, and increasingly on personal computers. 
Android: A mobile OS developed by Google, primarily used on smartphones and tablets. 
iOS: The mobile OS developed by Apple for iPhones and iPads. 
In essence, the operating system is the foundation upon which all other software runs, enabling users to interact with and utilize the computer's capabilities.
