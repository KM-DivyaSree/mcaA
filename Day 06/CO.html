<h1> Comuter Organisation</h1>
<p>
Difference Between Computer Architecture And Computer ...
Computer organization refers to the physical structure and interconnection of the components within a computer system, encompassing how hardware elements work together to execute instructions. It's the realization of the architecture, focusing on operational attributes like control signals, hardware details, and peripherals. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Interconnection of Components:
Computer organization deals with how the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and other hardware components are physically connected and communicate. 
Hardware Implementation:
It focuses on the practical implementation of the architectural specifications, including the design of circuits, buses, and other hardware elements. 
Operational Attributes:
Computer organization encompasses the operational aspects of the system, such as how data is moved, processed, and stored. 
Distinction from Architecture:
While computer architecture defines the system's overall structure and functionality as seen by the software, computer organization focuses on the hardware realization and implementation details. 
Examples:
CPU organization: The arrangement of registers, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and control unit within the CPU. 
Memory organization: How memory is structured, accessed, and managed. 
Input/Output organization: How input and output devices are connected and controlled. </p>
